# Lie-believer Sentiments
Truth, is mostly housed by walls built on facts, and floors cast on solid evidence. _"Delilah, the most beautiful woman on earth used charm and woman-power to separate lies from facts, and so helped the Philistines capture the most strongest man Samson"_. At least, that's how my late father would describe __emotional persuasion__. Decades later, I learnt to dwell and catch life inside these walls of truth. But, there are a bunch of other people - on this planet - who don't want to tell nor believe the truth. Like bush fires, they viciously start or pedal lies and non-truths brewed from conspiracy theories and misinformation. 

And, these naysayers usually attract sizeable crowds of lie-believers that mill around their fictional theories like greyhounds going for a kill! As a visual story teller, _I often wonder what kind of emotions, feelings and opinion-polarities (sentiments) are contained in comments from lie-believers._ In my recent travels - Social Media, of course - I met __Megyn Kelly__, a news anchor at Fox News, talking about the son of Joseph, the famous carpenter from Nazareth; a city in the Middle East, who suddenly became 'white', like the European Santa Claus. Jamelle Blouie, an editor from the Daily Beast and Eric Marrapodi of CNN picked on this "Christmas misinformation". 

Well, there is only one way of quenching my thirst through the __'naysayers, and lie-believers project'__...hunt 'em down! I'll scrape comments from these two YouTube videos (Fox News and CNN's) via the YouTube API and perform __a sentiment analysis in R__. 

__"Belief Blog: Sorry, Jesus isn't white"__. CNN, YouTube, December 14, 2013 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Dlz8bBokw). CNN's __Eric Marrapodi__ and the Daily Beasts' __Jamelle Blouie__ discuss Fox News anchor __Megyn Kelly's__ remark about Jesus being white (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XYlJqf4dLI). Jamelle wrote an open response to Kelly's misinformation (https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-megyn-kelly-santa-can-be-black-and-jesus-too).

__Kelly the seed:__ The Fox news YouTube video has a VideoID - 7XYlJqf4dLI.
