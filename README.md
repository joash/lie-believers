Truth, is mostly housed inside walls built on facts, and floors cast on solid evidence. If you are inside, you would know. At least, that's how my late father would describe __emotional persuasion__. Decades later, I've learnt to dwell inside these walls of truth. But there are folks who have built shanties around the truth. I wonder what kind of emotional persuasion that powers this spectrum of humans who don't want to tell nor believe the truth. Like bush fires, these naysayers viciously start or pedal non-truths brewed from conspiracy theories and misinformation. 

Most intriguing is that these 'lie-scatters' usually attract sizeable crowds of 'lie-believers' who mill around their fictional theories like moths over a flame! As a data story teller, _I often need to understand the kind of emotions, feelings and opinion-polarities (sentiments) that are contained in comments from 'lie-believers'._ In my recent travels - _on Social Media, this time of Covid-19 lockdowns_ - I met __Megyn Kelly__, a news anchor at Fox News. She insists that the preacher son of Joseph, the famous carpenter from Nazareth, a famous city in the Middle East, was 'white man', like the European Santa Claus. This wouldn't be possibly true. Jamelle Blouie, an editor from the Daily Beast and Eric Marrapodi of CNN picked on this "Christmas misinformation". 

Oh, boy...these kind of encounters leave me feeling like the sun is doing some temperature tricks on me. There is only one way of quenching my thirst. I'll grab Kelly's story into my __'lie-believer-project'__ ,_in R of course_, and hunt 'em liars down! I'll scrape comments from these two YouTube videos (Fox News and CNN's) via the YouTube API and perform __sentiment analysis__. 

__"Belief Blog: Sorry, Jesus isn't white"__. CNN, YouTube, December 14, 2013 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Dlz8bBokw). CNN's __Eric Marrapodi__ and the Daily Beasts' __Jamelle Blouie__ discuss Fox News anchor __Megyn Kelly's__ remark about Jesus being white (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XYlJqf4dLI). Jamelle wrote an open response to Kelly's misinformation (https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-megyn-kelly-santa-can-be-black-and-jesus-too).
