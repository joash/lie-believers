Truth, is mostly housed in walls built on facts, and floors cast on solid evidence. _"Delilah, the most beautiful woman on earth used her charm and woman-power to separate lies from facts, and so helped the Philistines capture their loathed enemy Samson"_. At least, that's how my late father would describe __emotional persuasion__. Decades later, I've learnt to dwell and catch life inside these walls of truth, while failing to understand the emotional persuasion that powers a bunch of other people - on this planet - who don't want to tell nor believe the truth. Like bush fires, these naysayers viciously start or pedal lies and non-truths brewed from conspiracy theories and misinformation. 

And, these 'lie-scatters' usually attract sizeable crowds of 'lie-believers' that mill around their fictional theories like greyhounds going for an easy kill! As a data story teller, _I often wonder what kind of emotions, feelings and opinion-polarities (sentiments) are contained in comments from 'lie-believers'._ In my recent travels - Social Media, of course - I met __Megyn Kelly__, a news anchor at Fox News, purpoting that the son of Joseph, the famous carpenter from Nazareth, a famous city in the Middle East, suddenly became 'white', like the European Santa Claus. This is insane! Jamelle Blouie, an editor from the Daily Beast and Eric Marrapodi of CNN picked on this "Christmas misinformation". 

Oh, boy...there is only one way of quenching my thirst. I'll start a __'lie-believer-project'__ ,_in R of course_, and hunt 'em down! I'll scrape comments from these two YouTube videos (Fox News and CNN's) via the YouTube API and perform __a sentiment analysis in R__. 

__"Belief Blog: Sorry, Jesus isn't white"__. CNN, YouTube, December 14, 2013 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Dlz8bBokw). CNN's __Eric Marrapodi__ and the Daily Beasts' __Jamelle Blouie__ discuss Fox News anchor __Megyn Kelly's__ remark about Jesus being white (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XYlJqf4dLI). Jamelle wrote an open response to Kelly's misinformation (https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-megyn-kelly-santa-can-be-black-and-jesus-too).

__Kelly the seed:__ The Fox news YouTube video has a VideoID - 7XYlJqf4dLI.
